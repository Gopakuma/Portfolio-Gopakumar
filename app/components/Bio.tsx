                As an experienced backend developer, I thrive on crafting elegant code.
                My toolkit includes JavaScript, Node.js, React.js and Java Spring Boot.
                But you know what? I’m not one to rest on my laurels - I’m currently diving
                into Next.js and mastering the art of Tailwind CSS.
